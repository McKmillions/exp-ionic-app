### Global Installs (may require sudo)

Install ionic CLI
`npm install -g ionic`

Please install your Cordova CLI
`npm install -g cordova`

Install ios-sim to deploy iOS applications.
`npm install -g ios-sim`

Install ios-deploy to deploy iOS applications to devices.
`npm install -g ios-deploy`

### Some helpful tips:

Run your app in the browser (great for initial development):
  `ionic serve`

	`ionic serve --lab` run the app in the browser to preview the app better as in Android and iOS.

Run on a device or simulator:
  `ionic run ios` [android,browser]

Test and share your app on device with Ionic View:
  http://view.ionic.io

### package.json
Now, run the command `npm install` from directly inside the expense-6-mobile-app folder.

### For every Cordova plugin you were using, type the command:

ionic plugin add [cordova-plugin-name]

## Setting up Cordova with Android SDK (Mac)

homebrew (you can use this on a mac, if you're on windows you'll have to download them manually) Copy and paste this into your terminal
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Install java 8
`brew cask install java`

(you might have to do this if cask is not installed already)
`brew tap caskroom/cask`
`brew install brew-cask`

Install Ant - The quickest way to install Apache Ant is with Homebrew.
`brew install ant`

Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html. This will let you install an editor that comes bundled with the Android SDK

### Setup path's in your bash profile
Edit .bash_profile
`vim ~/.bash_profile`

Youâ€™ll just need to change the path to the SDK. You want to include the SDK tools and SDK Platform-tools.

Add this:

```
export PATH=${PATH}:/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/sdk/platform-tools:/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/sdk/tools
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```

To exit vim `ESC/:/wq/enter`

### Create Virtual device
Open Android Studio > Tools > Android > AVD Manager

Then create your virtual device to emulate on the desktop

Now add the android platform to android:

`ionic platform add android`

`ionic build android`

`ionic emulate android`

Open Adroid Studio and navigate to Tools/Android/SDK Manager then Launch Standalone SDK Manager. Find Android 7.0 (API 24) and install it's packages and accept all of it's Licenses.

`ionic build android --release` <-- look into this
